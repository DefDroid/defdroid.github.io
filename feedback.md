Disruptive app behavior is an important problem that we envision will be
more and more prevelant given the trend of open computing platform and 
wide availability of mobile devices. As researchers, we can take a 
systematic approach to study the problem and propose practical solution 
to address it. But the success largely depends on data from the field
to validate our understanding, design and evaluation.

You can help contribute to the DefDroid project by 

1. using DefDroid and let us know how it performs in the field
2. telling us about some of the frustracting user experiences of some rogue apps
3. submitting patches (pull requests) to the DefDroid source code

For (1): please go to the [Downloads](/downloads.html) page and 
post to the [user group](http://groups.google.com/group/defdroid) for discussion.
