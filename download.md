# Guide for building DefDroid

## Generic instructions
The hardware requirements to build DefDroid are roughly the same as building the original
Android release: you need to have a decent machine running 64-bit Linux or Mac OS: 8+ 
GB RAM, 100+ GB storage (preferablly SSD), and fast Internet connection.

### Prepare build environment
Before the actual building, make sure you have JDK 7, and prepare the build environment 
by following the Android [build guide](https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html) 
to install necessary libraries and packages. For example, if your machine is running 
Ubuntu 14.04, run the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential \
  zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 \
  lib32ncurses5-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z-dev ccache \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc unzip
{% endhighlight %}

### Install `repo` command
Android release uses a Git wrapper called `repo` to manage the source code. Get it
with

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ PATH=~/bin:$PATH
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
{% endhighlight %}

### <a name="source_initialize"></a>Initialize source code repository
First, create the workspace to store the source code and build result: 
`mkdir -p ~/android/defdroid`. In the following, we assume the workspace is in 
`~/android/defdroid`. If you chose a different path, make sure to substitute it
accordingly.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/android/defdroid
$ repo init -u <repo_url> -b <branch> 
$ repo sync
{% endhighlight %}

Replace `<repo_url>` and `<branch>` with the desired Android base repo and branch
that DefDroid has been ported to:

{:.table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Release | Version | `<repo_url>` | `<branch>` |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| [CM](http://www.cyanogenmod.org) | 11.0 | `https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git` | `cm-11.0` |
| [AOSP](https://source.android.com/index.html) | 4.4 | `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest` | `android-4.4.4_r1` |
| [AOSP](https://source.android.com/index.html) | 5.1 | `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest` | `android-5.1.1_r3` |

The last step (`repo sync`) would take a while to download the repository.

### Enable `ccache`
To speed up the building process on re-compilation, it is recommended to enable
`ccache`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ export USE_CCACHE=1
$ export CCACHE_DIR=<path-to-your-cache-directory>
$ prebuilts/misc/linux-x86/ccache/ccache -M 50G
{% endhighlight %}

The `CCACHE_DIR` setting by default is in `~/.ccache`.


## Build for [CM](http://www.cyanogenmod.org) 11.0

### Source code repository customization
The repo command to be used in the [initialization step](#source_initialize) for CM 
11.0 build is `repo init -u https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-11.0`.
Then get the DefDroid modifications by using the local manifests approach:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir .repo/local_manifests
$ git clone git@github.com:DefDroid/defdroid_local_cm_falcon.git .repo/local_manifests
$ repo sync
{% endhighlight %}

### Get prebuilt apps in CM
This step only needs to be done once to populate the built-in apps from CM into the
repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/android/defdroid/vendor/cm
$ ./get-prebuilts
{% endhighlight %}

### Prepare device-dependent code and blobs
To build a working image for a particular device usually requires device-dependent code
and proprietary blobs to be pulled in the repo. In CM release, this is mainly handled 
with `breakfast` command and some scripts. For example, to build for Motorola G device, 
you need to run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/android/defdroid
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ breakfast falcon
{% endhighlight %}

Then you need to pull the proprietary blobs from the device: connect your Motorola G 
device to your computer via USB; make sure the `adb` command from Android SDK is in 
your PATH; and ironically, your Motorola G should already be running a CM release
for the following script to work:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/android/defdroid/device/motorola/falcon
$ ./extract-files.sh
{% endhighlight %}

### Finally, build!
Using Motorola G target as an example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ croot
$ brunch falcon
{% endhighlight %}
