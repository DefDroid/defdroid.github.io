## Overview

  The strong growth of mobile computing has led to an explosion of mobile apps.
  The problem is that many mobile apps are not well written and misbehave
  when installed on end users' smartphone.

  DefDroid aims to address a rising class of issues in mobile apps in which some
  app acts aggressively to its hosting ecosystem (e.g., keep searching GPS,
  wake up the device frequently, frequently download large data via cellular
  network). We call these issues **Disruptive App Behavior** (DAB). 
  Table 1 below shows some common disruptive app behavior that we have examined
  in a study of more than 9,000 mobile user posts and reports. (If you encounter 
  some of them or new kinds of app issues in your smartphone, we'd be happy to 
  [hear from you](/feedback.html).

  Disruptive app behavior is annoying to users because it affects not
  only the app itself (e.g., compared to normal app defects that cause
  crash or unresponsive) but also hurts user experiences for the other 
  apps on the same device due to battery drain, excessive usage of data 
  plan, overusage of storage space, etc. 

  DefDroid provides a system-level solution to address disruptive app
  behavior by making the mobile OS more defensive so that even if some
  apps have defects that can cause disruptive behavior, the OS will
  actively intervene to adjust the app execution and minimize potential
  negative impact to battery, data plan or storage.
