Thank you for participating in the DefDroid experiment!

For this experiment, we only collect data lightly. 
To be specific, when DefDroid discovers a potential 
naughty app and takes action to correct the app's misbehavior, 
it will log 
<ul>
<li>the timestamp</li>
<li>app name</li>
<li>OS actions</li>
<li>a field explaining the reason for the action</li>

We will collect this log and no other information. If you 
are an advanced user, you can examine the content of the log 
through ADB at /data/system/defense.log.
